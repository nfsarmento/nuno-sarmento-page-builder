Nuno Sarmento Page Builder, an easy-to-use WordPress Plugin that enables you to create beautiful, professional and responsive WordPress pages.

== Description ==

I have tried to keep this plugin as simple as possible, you are not going to be overwhelmed with options like some of the page builder plugins out there.

Nuno Sarmento Page Builder is the simplest way to build WordPress pages. Just drag and drop suitable elements, construct content visually without any lines of code and get the instant view of what is going on with WordPress live preview.

At this stage I haven't implemented every Page Builder feature, but if there is a feature that you'd really like to see, please let me know.
